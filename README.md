# Social Media Web Application

## Deployment
Deployed at: https://socialmedia-sigma-indol.vercel.app/

## Goal
- My goal with this project was to gain experience using more technologies. I already had experience using Vite/React in JavaScript and MongoDB. 
- I wanted to try some new technologies, so I used NextJS/React in TypeScript and PostgreSQL. I also used Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication.


## Stack
- Full-stack with NextJS, React, and TypeScript using App Router and API routes.
- PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.
- Authentication using Google OAuth 2.0.
- Styled using the NextUI library.
- Deployed with Vercel.
